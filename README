Smooth Sailing plugin for X-Plane 9

This project is an X-plane plugin by <a href="http://www.cactusflower.org">Colin Lieberman</a> for making some convenient changes to time and weather.

It's inspired by, and similar to, these two excellent projects:

* [Clear Skies](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=1728) by [dad](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?&showuser=7519)
* [FlyVFR](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=12661) by [http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showuser=82559](X-Friese)

The difference between this effort and those is that this one is focused on convenience only - doing things automatically so you don't have to tell the system how you want to change the wind, for example, and focusing solely on those changes.

The game plan for what I will build is detailed on the [specification page](wiki/Spec).
